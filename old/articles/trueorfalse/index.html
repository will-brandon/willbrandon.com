		<h3>The Case of Unlucky Travis</h3>
		<section class="in">
			<p>
				“Is this going to be the year I finally win something off these dumb scratch tickets you get me every
				Christmas?” Travis asks, grinning and waving a pair of tickets above his head.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’ve bought you the same tickets twenty-one years in a row, babe, and every year you manage to scratch
				off losing numbers!” Susan exclaims with a little chuckle.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s not my fault. You’re the one who picks the crumby numbers. These tickets have had losing numbers
				since you bought them off of the shelf of the gas station. In fact, they’ve been losers since they were
				printed.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s not the case, Travis, those numbers could be anything under there. The numbers don’t truly
				appear until you scratch the ticket. That’s why it’s <i>your</i> silly luck.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s quite the logic you have there. Surely you can’t be serious? You don’t actually think the
				numbers just appear like magic, do you?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Why yes, they do. You just haven’t heard of the Schrödinger cat thought experiment.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don’t care about experiments, I’m not crazy, I <i>know for a fact</i> that a losing ticket becomes a
				losing ticket the minute it is printed!”
			</p>
			<p>
				** Travis opens the pair of tickets **
			</p>
			<p>
				“Aw man, two more losses.”
			</p>

				It seems like Susan won’t admit that her own misfortune has landed these bad tickets. As Travis says, it has to be her luck when she buys the ticket, right?
			</p>
			<p>
				Before we jump to conclusions, let’s critically analyze Travis’s supposed “knowledge.” We must wonder, what type of knowledge we can hold about an event that has not yet happened. Specifically, let’s attempt to answer the following question: in the case of scratch tickets, can anyone “know for a fact” that the state of the ticket was determined upon its printing? If we can’t prove that this knowledge exists, then we can’t yet disprove Susan’s argument that this misfortune all occurs the minute Travis scratches the ticket.
			</p>
			<p>
				To further analyze our knowledge of a situation such as the scratch ticket scenario, let us first adopt a definition of knowledge. According to Plato, “knowledge is justified true belief.” Using this, we can conclude that for someone such as Travis to know that a scratch ticket’s winning state is determined upon its printing:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The ticket’s number must actually be created upon printing</li>
				<li>Travis would have to believe that it was created upon printing</li>
				<li>Travis would have to have justified belief that this is the case</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				First off, to confirm whether the ticket was created with a predefined number, we can watch a video such as the one found at this link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgBZRevzEJU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgBZRevzEJU</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				However, this is simply knowledge by testimony because we are trusting that the process appearing in this video is precisely how every ticket is made. To be sure by perception, we would need to visit a scratch ticket factory and watch the specific ticket in question be made right in front of us. But let’s put this flaw aside and assume, for the sake of our argument, that this is true, that all tickets do truly get their numbers from the initial printing. Next, Travis must believe that the numbers came from the printing process. He clearly does since he is bothering to make this argument. Lastly, he must have justification for this belief. Maybe Travis has seen the video above and that is his justification.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this line of reasoning, we can confirm that Travis truly does “know” that the ticket was printed with a number at the factory. However, this is according to the Correspondence Theory of Truth. This relies heavily on the idea that truth must correspond to some truth state of reality which in turn assumes that there is a definitive truth state. Consider that the factory is automated, and nobody saw the ticket being made. This is quite likely the case with modern scratch tickets. Therefore, not a single person on earth can truthfully testify that they witnessed Travis's specific ticket being given a number upon printing. This is Susan’s line of reasoning when she brought up the Schrödinger experiment.

		<h3>Schrödinger’s Cat</h3>
		<section>
			<div id="left">
				<p>
					In 1935, quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger developed a thought experiment to explain a new unique
					theory of truth. In his experiment, a house cat would be left in a closed cardboard box. Also in the
					box would be a closed bottle of poison. A special quantum contraption next to the bottle would have
					exactly a fifty percent chance of breaking the bottle, expelling the poison, and killing the cat.
				</p>
				<p>
					He stated that while the box was closed, the cat was neither definitively dead nor alive. He argued
					that until someone opened the box, the cat would exist in both states. Therefore, if the box was
					opened and the cat was dead, the person who opened the box effectively killed the cat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Try the experiment! Click "Open Box" to see what's inside.

			<p>
				Keeping Schrödinger’s Theory of Truth in mind, let's now reconsider Travis's ticket. No one saw it being
				made. Therefore, we have no root evidence by process of perception that the ticket was given a number. All we can
				conclude is that it had a number when it was opened. Whether that number came from a printer or was
				spawned into existence immediately upon scratching the ticket is a mystery.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unless Travis brought forward undeniable proof that his exact ticket was printed featuring a losing number, Susan can always claim that his ticket had a completely fair chance. She'll say that it existed in both a potential winning state and a potential losing state until it was opened.
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at it this way: if you win the lottery, you can take complete credit. You made your own fortune.
				You created a winning number.
